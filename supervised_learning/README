This subdir is experimental. We wanted to:

1. annotate data from the live videos we took

2. train a SUPERVISED learning neural network offloader
   - input features:
     - read from offloader_DNN_features/offloader_DNN_input_features.txt

    - columns:
        SVM_confidence
        embedding_distance
        face_confidence
        frame_diff_val
        numeric_prediction
        unknown_flag
        num_detect

   - call run_train_offloader_DNN.sh 
   - this calls: 
        - python3 train_supervised_learning_offloader.py 

   - train/test median percentage errors should be around 10%

    - this saves the neural net in: 
    /keras_offloader_DNN/offloader_DNN_model/
        - feature_scaler.save: feature scaler 
        - model.offload.yaml: model def
        - weights.offload.h5: model weights

3. quantify the performance on test videos

4. deploy on the Jetson TX2 live video camera

5. quantify the results
