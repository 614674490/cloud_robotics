EVALUATE A TRAINED RL AGENT

./eval_pretrain_RL_FourAction_fnet.sh

	1. call RL_TRAINER_DIR/evaluate_RL_offload_utils.py to run RL agent on TEST traces and save results


	2. call FourAction_policy_rollouts.py
		to run the baselines on the SAME test traces

	3. call boxplot_FourAction_env.py to plot all the results over traces to see RL's gains
